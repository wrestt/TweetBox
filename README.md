# TweetBOX

Twitter and Spotify collide to bring you a social jukebox! TweetBOX is an AngularJS web app that allows users to dynamically create a Spotfiy playlist using Twitter. Tweets are pulled using the Twitter API and their content is then used to search Spotify's API, which ultimately returns a track that is added to the user's playlist.

Using TweetBOX:
 1. Authorize the app to use your Spotify and Twitter accounts by logging in when prompted by the site.
 2. Click the Create Playlist button to get started.

 3. As a user you can:
  * Search for artists and songs in the toolbar
  * Add and remove songs from the playlist
  * See similar songs to those currently located in the playlist
  * Preview, play, and pause songs
  * Reorder the songs within the playlist
  * Invite others to add to the playlist by tweeting at **@\<your_twitter_handle\>** an artist and/or song title
  * Save the playlist

The app is currently located at **obscure-brushlands-6394.herokuapp.com**. Feel free to try it out!
